# Advent of Code Solutions 2020

## Project Architecture

## Inputs

My personal inputs are not shared in this repository.

Althouhg it is not strictly forbidden it is [asked by the creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e7khy8/are_everyones_input_data_and_by_extension/fa13hb9/) to not share/collect personal inputs.

To run the solution on an input after the Day was created the command `npm run start -- get {day}` can be run.
